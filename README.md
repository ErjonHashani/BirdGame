## 🎯 Game Description
Bird Game is a 2D level-based game where the player controls a bird by dragging it with the mouse (or finger on touchscreens) and releasing it to hit enemies (monsters). Inspired by **Angry Birds** 🦅, the goal is to eliminate all enemies to progress to the next level.

The bird moves based on the direction and strength of the player's drag, with a visual LineRenderer effect. When the bird hits enemies, they disappear in a "poof" effect 💨.
